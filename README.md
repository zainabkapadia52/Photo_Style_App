# Photo Style Consistency App

[![**Open in Streamlit**](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://zainabkapadia52-photo-style.streamlit.app)

## Overview
This web application applies histogram matching to transfer the tonal characteristics of a target (reference) image to one or more source images. By matching the brightness, contrast, and overall pixel intensity distribution, the app helps you achieve a consistent style across a collection of imagesâ€”perfect for photographers, content creators, and designers.

## Features
- **Target & Source Upload:** Upload a target style image and multiple source images.
- **Histogram Matching with Blending:** Adjust the strength of the effect using an interactive blending slider.
- **Color Image Processing:** Processes images in the YCrCb color space to preserve color information.
- **Interactive Visualization:** View interactive histograms for the source, target, and processed images using Plotly.
- **Download Options:** Download the processed images directly from the interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
